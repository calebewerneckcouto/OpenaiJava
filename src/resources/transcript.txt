00:00:00:00 - 00:00:02:05
Have you ever had this nightmare?

00:00:02:05 - 00:00:07:03
Your overhangs collapse, filament goes
wild and your print turns into spaghetti.

00:00:08:03 - 00:00:09:27
What a bummer.

00:00:09:27 - 00:00:12:23
But don't worry, we can fix it.

00:00:12:23 - 00:00:15:27
All of this can be avoided
with support settings.

00:00:16:21 - 00:00:20:00
Today we're diving into how to set up
supports that are stable,

00:00:20:12 - 00:00:23:03
easy to remove, and filament saving.

00:00:23:03 - 00:00:25:19
First, a little diagnosis for your model.

00:00:25:19 - 00:00:28:02
Does your model even need supports?

00:00:28:02 - 00:00:30:01
There's two ways to figure this out.

00:00:30:01 - 00:00:33:18
Drop your model into Creality
print 6.1 and hit preview.

00:00:34:10 - 00:00:38:07
If you see a little floating warning
icon in the bottom left corner. Yep.

00:00:38:23 - 00:00:42:15
Now that means some areas
are hanging in the air and need support.

00:00:43:02 - 00:00:45:19
You can also check show in printer

00:00:45:19 - 00:00:48:15
and look at the overhang wall percentage.

00:00:48:15 - 00:00:52:03
Once you see an overhang
wall, it's a time to be careful.

00:00:52:11 - 00:00:53:08
It means there are

00:00:53:08 - 00:00:57:23
lots of unsupported overhangs
and you'll definitely want to add support.

00:00:57:27 - 00:01:00:12
Go to the support tab on the left.

00:01:00:12 - 00:01:03:11
Toggle on enable support and boom!

00:01:03:11 - 00:01:05:25
The software
auto generate support for you.

00:01:05:25 - 00:01:09:01
How to choose support types and placement
methods.

00:01:09:05 - 00:01:14:06
First, support types for large and flat
overhangs like bridges and platforms.

00:01:14:07 - 00:01:16:23
We go with normal supports.

00:01:16:23 - 00:01:20:02
It's steady,
it's smooth, and it's lightning fast.

00:01:20:15 - 00:01:24:11
And for small or tricky parts
like fingers or tiny details.

00:01:24:24 - 00:01:27:08
Our go to setting is tree supports.

00:01:27:08 - 00:01:30:23
Always easier to remove
and more filament saving.

00:01:31:00 - 00:01:33:10
Now time to pick the placement method.

00:01:33:10 - 00:01:36:09
You can just go with automatic support
and here you go.

00:01:36:09 - 00:01:38:24
Everything will be auto done here.

00:01:38:24 - 00:01:41:03
Super helpful if you're just starting out.

00:01:41:03 - 00:01:46:08
But for veteran makers who know your model
well, there's also manual supports

00:01:46:08 - 00:01:49:15
for you
where you can use the paintbrush tool

00:01:49:24 - 00:01:52:24
to add support only where you want.

00:01:52:27 - 00:01:58:00
Super handy in selecting
and avoiding areas in support settings.

00:01:58:05 - 00:02:00:20
More doesn't always mean better.

00:02:00:20 - 00:02:03:27
Use it where it actually help
and it's all done.
